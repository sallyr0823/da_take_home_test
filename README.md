# Take Home Test
This is the take home test for Fetch Rewards - Data Analytics Internship.

### Data
Data folders store the original data.

### EER Diagram
EER Diagram is the structured relational data model. The model links four datasets: **users, receipts, receipt_items and brands** together.

For each dataset, some useless fields are dropped to save for space and time.

### Query.md
In Query.md, all questions are answered with a SQL query.

It's written in MySQL dialect.

### Data Analysis.ipynb
This notebook show some further analysis on data that I want to share with the stakeholder. 

In the first part, I focus on the quality of data as I find missing value will influence the results a lot.

For the second part, I share some interesting consumption behaviors with stakeholders which I find based on data.
